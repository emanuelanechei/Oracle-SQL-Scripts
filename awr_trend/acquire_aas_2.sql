REM                    Adding the another SQL query with the similar metric_name "Average Active Sessions" but the same intention.          
REM
REM     Last tested:
REM             11.2.0.4
REM             19.3.0.0
REM             21.3.0.0
REM
REM     Purpose:
REM       It's the 2nd version (which is more simple and easy to understand than the 1st) of acquire_aas.sql,
REM       you can see "https://github.com/guestart/Oracle-SQL-Scripts/blob/master/awr_trend/acquire_aas.sql".
REM
REM       You can find out metric_name "DB Time Per Second" and metric_unit "CentiSeconds" in the view "v$metric",
REM       but oracle adjusts the corresponding metric_name to become "Database Time Per Sec" in the view
REM       "DBA_HIST_SYSMETRIC_SUMMARY".
REM
REM       Typically there saves the average value of "Database Time Per Sec" in each of snap_id of the SDDV
REM       (Static Data Dictionary View), "DBA_HIST_SYSMETRIC_SUMMARY", (in which the value of its column
REM       "metric_name" is "Database Time Per Sec" and "metric_unit" is "CentiSeconds Per Second"), here we use
REM       the analytic function "LAG () OVER()" to get the prior snap_id from current snap_id for more clearly
REM       showing "AAS" between these two snap_id.
